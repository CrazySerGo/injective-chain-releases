# Sync From Our Snapshot

Sync from a snapshot is the easiest/quickest way to sync the injective node.

Follow manual process [here.][sync-guide-link]

Or use automation [sync script](../scripts/README.md)

Daily archival snapshots are available on [quicksync link](https://quicksync.io/networks/injective.html).

**NOTE:**  You always have the option to sync your sentry from scratch via public sentries, which is a more decentralized approach.

# Sync From Scratch 

Due to breaking changes we made and [Canonical Chain Mainnet](https://blog.injectiveprotocol.com/injective-canonical-chain-mainnet-release/) release, you will need to sync using different binary versions.

It's a seamless process, and [Official guide.](https://chain.injective.network/guides/mainnet/join-network.html) will help you join the network sync from scratch to Canonical Chain latest network block.
